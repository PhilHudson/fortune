    King Arthur: The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering
    samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by
    divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. [singing stops]

    Dennis: Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis

    from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

    Arthur: Be quiet!

    Dennis: You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some
    watery tart threw a sword at you!

    Arthur: Shut up!

    Dennis: I mean, if I went around saying I was an emperor just because some
    moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!

Oh, what I wouldn't give to be spat at in the face. I sometimes hang awake at

    Mandy: And that's Capricorn, is it?

    Wise man: No, no, no. That's just him.

O Lord, please don't burn us.
Don't grill or toast your flock.
Don't put us on the barbecue
Or simmer us in stock.
Don't braise or bake or boil us,
Or stir-fry us in a wok.
