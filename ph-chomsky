Any institution marked by domination and hierarchy must rise to the challenge of
justifying itself, and if it cannot meet the challenge, it should be dismantled.

The sign of a truly totalitarian culture is that important truths simply lack
cognitive meaning and are interpretable only at the level of 'Fuck You', so they
can then elicit a perfectly predictable torrent of abuse in response.

        -- Noam Chomsky, letter to Alexander Cockburn, 1 March 1990

%
A principle familiar to propagandists is that the doctrine to be instilled in
the target audience should not be articulated: that would only expose them to
reflection, inquiry, and, very likely, ridicule. The proper procedure is to
drill them home by constantly presupposing them, so that they become the very
condition for discourse.

If you have to meet [TV's] condition of concision, you can only either repeat
conventional platitudes or else sound like you are from Neptune. That is, if you
say anything that’s not conventional, it’s going to sound very strange.

… This structural requirement of concision that’s imposed by our media disallows
the possibility of explanation; in fact, that’s its propaganda function. It
means that you can repeat conventional platitudes, but you can’t say anything
out of the ordinary without sounding as if you’re from Neptune, a wacko, because
to explain what you meant – and people have a right to ask if it’s an
unconventional thought – would take a little bit of time.

I was attracted to anarchism as a young teenager, as soon as I began to think
about the world beyond a pretty narrow range, and haven't seen much reason to
revise those early attitudes since. I think it only makes sense to seek out and
identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of
life, and to challenge them; unless a justification for them can be given, they
are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of human
freedom. That includes political power, ownership and management, relations
among men and women, parents and children, our control over the fate of future
generations (the basic moral imperative behind the environmental movement, in my
view), and much else.

The major media [...] are corporations 'selling' privileged audiences to other

What can one say about a country where a museum of science in a great city can
feature an exhibit in which people fire machine guns from a helicopter at
Vietnamese huts, with a light flashing when a hit is scored? What can one say

this country. [...] To me it seems that what is needed is a kind of
denazification.

The consistent anarchist, then, should be a socialist, but a socialist of a
particular sort. He will not only oppose alienated and specialized labor and
look forward to the appropriation of capital by the whole body of workers, but
he will also insist that this appropriation be direct, not exercised by some
elite force acting in the name of the proletariat.

It is the fundamental duty of the citizen to resist and to restrain the violence
of the state. Those who choose to disregard this responsibility can justly be
accused of complicity in war crimes, which is itself designated as ‘a crime

Personally I'm in favor of democracy, which means that the central institutions
in the society have to be under popular control. Now, under capitalism we can't
have democracy by definition. Capitalism is a system in which the central
institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control. Thus, a
corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms,
fascist; that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be
established at every level -- there's a little bargaining, a little give and
take, but the line of authority is perfectly straightforward. Just as I'm
opposed to political fascism, I'm opposed to economic fascism. I think that
until major institutions of society are under the popular control of
participants and communities, it's pointless to talk about democracy.

The success of the Free Press in reconstructing imperial ideology since the U.S.
withdrawal has been spectacular. The shift of the United States from causal
agent to bystander – and even to leader of the struggle for human rights – in
the face of its empire of client fascism and long, vicious assault on the
peasant societies of Indochina, is a remarkable achievement. The system of
brainwashing under freedom, with mass media voluntary self-censorship in accord
with the larger interests of the state, has worked brilliantly.

A corporate elite of managers and owners governs the economy and the political
system as well, at least in very large measure. The people, so-called, do

France is doing some really vicious things [in Oceania], in fact they're just
wiping out islands because they want them for nuclear tests. And when the
socialist government in France is asked, "Why to do this?", they say, "Well
look, we have to have nuclear tests." Well, if you have to have nuclear tests,
why not have them in southern France? [audience laughter] Why have them in some
island in the Pacific? Well, the answer to that is clear, after all they're just
a bunch of little brown people or something. But you can't say that exactly,
especially if you're a socialist, so something else is said.

From a comparative perspective, the United States is unusual if not unique in
the lack of restraints on freedom of expression. It is also unusual in the range
and effectiveness of methods employed to restrain freedom of thought… Where the
voice of the people is heard, elite groups must insure their voice says the
right things… The less the state is able to employ violence in the defense of
the interest of the elite groups that effectively dominate it, the more it
becomes necessary to devise techniques of ‘manufacture of consent’… Where
obedience is guaranteed by violence, rulers may tend towards a ‘behaviourist’
conception; it is enough that people obey; what they think does not matter too
much. Where the state lacks means of coercion, it is important to control what
people think.

Our point is not that the retrospectives fail to draw what seem to us, as to
much of the population, the obvious conclusions; the more significant and
instructive point is that principled objection to the [Vietnam] war as
“fundamentally wrong and immoral,” or as an outright criminal aggression - a war
crime - is inexpressible. It is not part of the spectrum of discussion. The
background for such a principled critique cannot be developed in the media, and
the conclusions cannot be drawn. It is not present even to be refuted. Rather,
the idea is unthinkable. All of this reveals with great clarity how foreign to
the mobilized media is a conception of the media as a free system of information
and discussion, independent of state authority and elite interests.

It goes back to the days when we were defending ourselves against the internal
aggression of the Native American population, who we incidentally wiped out in
the process. In the post World War II period, we've frequently had to carry out
defense against internal aggression, that is against Salvadorans in El Salvador,
Greeks in Greece, against Filipinos in the Philippines, against South Vietnamese
in South Vietnam, and many other places. And the concept of internal aggression
has been repeatedly invoked in this connection, and quite appropriately. It's an
interesting concept, it's one that George Orwell would certainly have admired,
and it's elaborated in many ways in the internal documentary record.

For those who stubbornly seek freedom around the world, there can be no more
urgent task than to come to understand the mechanisms and practices of
indoctrination. These are easy to perceive in the totalitarian societies, much

often we serve as unwilling or unwitting instruments.

If any of you have ever looked at your FBI file, you discover that intelligence
agencies in general are extremely incompetent. That's one of the reasons why
there are so many intelligence failures. They just never get anything straight,
for all kinds of reasons. Part of it is because of the information they get. The
information they get comes from ideological fanatics, typically, who always
misunderstand things in their own crazy way. If you look at an FBI file, say,
about yourself, where you know what the facts are, you'll see that the
information has some kind of relation to the facts, you can figure out what
they're talking about, but by the time it works its way through the ideological
fanaticism of the intelligence agencies, there's always weird distortion.

The point of public relations slogans like "Support Our Troops" is that they
don't mean anything ... that's the whole point of good propaganda. You want to
create a slogan that nobody is going to be against and I suppose everybody will
be for, because nobody knows what it means, because it doesn't mean anything.
But its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that
does mean something, do you support our policy? And that's the one you're not
allowed to talk about.

Control of thought is more important for governments that are free and popular
than for despotic and military states. The logic is straightforward: a despotic
state can control its domestic enemies by force, but as the state loses this
weapon, other devices are required to prevent the ignorant masses from
interfering with public affairs, which are none of their business.

Reactions to our adversity are not entirely uniform. At the dovish extreme, we
find Senator John Kerry, who warns that we should never again fight a war
"without committing enough resources to win"; no other flaw is mentioned. And
there is President Carter, the noted moral teacher and human rights apostle, who
assured us that we owe Vietnam no debt and have no responsibility to render it
any assistance because "the destruction was mutual," an observation so
uncontroversial as to pass with no reaction. [...] Properly statesmanlike,
President Bush announces that "It was a bitter conflict, but Hanoi knows today
that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past." Their
crimes against us can never be forgotten, but "we can begin writing the last
chapter of the Vietnam war" if they dedicate themselves with sufficient zeal to
the MIAs. We might even "begin helping the Vietnamese find and identify their
own combatants missing in action," [New York Times Asia correspondent] Crossette
reports. The adjacent front-page story reports Japan's failure, once again, to
"unambiguously" accept the blame "for its wartime aggression."

As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to

In the United States you're not allowed to talk about class differences. In
fact, only two groups are allowed to be class-conscious in the United States.
One of them is the business community, which is rabidly class-conscious. When
you read their literature, it's all full of the danger of the masses and their
rising power and how we have to defeat them. It's kind of vulgar, inverted
Marxism. The other group is the high planning sectors of the government. They
talk the same way — how we have to worry about the rising aspirations of the
common man and the impoverished masses who are seeking to improve standards and
harming the business climate. So they can be class-conscious. They have a job to
do. But it's extremely important to make other people, the rest of the
population, believe that there is no such thing as class. We're all just equal,
we're all Americans, we live in harmony, we all work together, everything is
great.

committed, you know, somebody is robbing someone else. Well, you have three
choices. One choice is to try to stop it, maybe you call 911 or something.
Another choice is to do nothing. A third choice is to pick up an assault rifle
and kill 'em both, and kill a bystander at the same time. Well, suppose you do
that, and somebody says, "Well, you know, why did you do that?" And you say,

Property rights are not like other rights, contrary to what Madison and a lot of
modern political theory says. If I have the right to free speech, it doesn't
interfere with your right to free speech. But if I have property, that
interferes with your right to have that property, you don't have it, I have it.
So the right to property is very different from the right to freedom of speech.
This is often put very misleadingly about rights of property; property has no
right.

The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the
spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that

presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the

Destruction of the environment is not only rational; it's exactly what you're
taught to do in college. If you take an economics or a political science course,
you're taught that humans are supposed to be rational wealth accumulators, each
acting as an individual to maximize his own wealth in the market. The market is
regarded as democratic because everybody has a vote. Of course, some have more
votes than others because your votes depend on the number of dollars you have,
but everybody participates and therefore it's called democratic. Well, suppose
that we believe what we are taught. It follows that if there are dollars to be
made, you destroy the environment. The reason is elementary. The people who are
going to be harmed by this are your grandchildren, and they don't have any votes
in the market. Their interests are worth zero. Anybody that pays attention to
their grandchildren's interests is being irrational, because what you're
supposed to do is maximize your own interests, measured by wealth, right now.
Nothing else matters. So destroying the environment and militarizing outer space
are rational policies, but within a framework of institutional lunacy. If you
accept the institutional lunacy, then the policies are rational.

Moral equivalence is a term of propaganda that was invented to try to prevent us

The US and Israel have demanded further that Palestinians not only recognize
Israel's rights as a state in the international system, but that they also
recognize Israel's abstract "right to exist," a concept that has no place in

and Israel are demanding that Palestinians not only recognize Israel in the
normal fashion of interstate relations, but also formally accept the legitimacy
of their expulsion from their own land. They cannot be expected to accept that,
just as Mexico does not grant the US the "right to exist" on half of Mexico's

Let us turn now to the most elementary principle of just war theory,
universality. Those who cannot accept this principle should have the decency to
keep silent about matters of right and wrong, or just war. If we can rise to
this level, some obvious questions arise: for example, have Cuba and Nicaragua
been entitled to set off bombs in Washington, New York, and Miami in
self-defense against ongoing terrorist attack? Particularly so when the
perpetrators are well known and act with complete impunity, sometimes in brazen
defiance of the highest international authorities, so that the cases are far
clearer than Afghanistan? If not, why not?

I mean, what's the elections? You know, two guys, same background, wealth,

society where you're trained to be a ruler - they both can run because they're

Barack Obama said, 'only in this country, only in America, could someone like me
appear here.' Well, in some other countries, people much poorer than him would
not only talk at the convention - they'd be elected president. Take Lula. The
president of Brazil is a guy with a peasant background, a union organizer, never
went to school, he's the president of the second-biggest country in the

you can choose somebody from your own ranks. With different policies. That's

After the invasion, there was sophisticated massive looting of the installations
that were constructed in the 1980s - that includes high-precision equipment
capable of making parts for nuclear and chemical weapons and missiles, and also
toxins for biological weapons. Prior to the US-British invasion, these sites had
been monitored by UN inspectors, but they were quickly kicked out of the country
and have not been back since, while the occupation forces left the sites
unguarded, and very sophisticated looting operations took place. Where this huge
massive equipment has gone no one knows, and it's uncomfortable to guess. The
ironies are almost inexpressible. The US and Britain invaded to prevent the use
of WMDs that did not exist, and they succeeded in providing the terrorists that
they had mobilized with the means to develop WMDs that the US and Britain had
provided to Saddam Hussein.

right of a Palestinian state to exist, which would, for example, exclude
Israel's Prime Minister Olmert, who received a rousing ovation in Congress when
he declared that Israel's historic right to the land from Jordan to the sea is
beyond question.

We're supposed to worship Adam Smith but you're not supposed to read him. That's
too dangerous. He's a dangerous radical.

The free market is socialism for the rich. Markets for the poor and state
protection for the rich.

Essentially liberal internationalists from Europe, Japan and the United States,
the liberal wing of the intellectual elite. That's where Jimmy Carter's whole
government came from. [...] [The Trilateral Commission] was concerned with
trying to induce what they called "more moderation in democracy"—turn people
back to passivity and obedience so they don't put so many constraints on state
power and so on. In particular they were worried about young people. They were
concerned about the institutions responsible for the indoctrination of the young
(that's their phrase), meaning schools, universities, church and so on—they're
not doing their job, [the young are] not being sufficiently indoctrinated.
They're too free to pursue their own initiatives and concerns and you've got to
control them better.

If I were to summarize the main points I’ve taken from Chomsky’s writings and
talks, they would be this: You should have both compassion and consistency, care
about freedom and fairness alike, and be rational, curious, and humble.

It is a tribute to the power of Chomsky’s political views and the evidence he
presents in their support that so many critics of his politics feel that the
best strategy for undermining them is to attack his linguistics.
